## Goldsberry

Goldsberry is a graph implementation written in C.

### Project Purpose

1. To refresh my C programming abilities
2. To refresh my code design abilities (e.g. modularity, encapsuation, design)
3. To refresh my knowledge about graphs

### Building

To build everything, type: `make`.
To build only the CLI, type `make goldsberry`.
To build only the test suite, type `make test`.
`make clean` works as expected. 

The only dependency is the C unit testing framework check: http://check.sourceforge.net/
