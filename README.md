A graph implementation and associated algorithms written in C.

This is certainly a WIP for now. The purpose of this project is (in no particular priority or order):

1. To refresh my C programming abilities
2. To refresh my code design abilities (e.g. modularity, encapsuation, design)
3. To refresh my knowledge about graphs and their associated algorithms
